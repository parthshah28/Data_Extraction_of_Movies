---

I have used bs4 (BeautifulSoup) library for Extracting Movie/TV Show Data.

**MongoDB** is used to store the data in database.

Information like **'Title','Time Period','Rating','Genre','Duration','Votes','Directors','Stars'** and **'Description'** are extracted.
These information are collected for 60,000+ Movies/TV Shows.

The Dataset has **60025** rows and **9** columns
